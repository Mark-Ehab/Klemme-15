## Project Overview

The Klemme-15 Car Control System is designed to control the operation of a car based on analog readings from a potentiometer. The system has three main modes: OFF, READY, and IGNITION. The modes are determined by the potentiometer's analog values and are indicated using LEDs and an LCD display.

## Usage

- OFF Mode: All LEDs are turned off, and the LCD display shows "OFF."
- READY Mode: The red LED is turned on, and the system waits for a specified duration before transitioning to ALERT mode.
- IGNITION Mode: The red and blue LEDs are turned on, indicating the ignition state.

## Dependencies

- Microcontroller: AVR (ATmega32)
- Development Environment: (Microchip Studio)
